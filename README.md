# Video Game Quiz Project

When trying to think of what to code for my second project, I was quiet stumped. I found JavaScript to be quiet difficult so I decided to keep my project as simple as possible. So I went for the idea of making a simple quix and combining it with one of my interests, video games. The quiz is based off some simple classic video game knowledge that is hopefully quiet general so as a broader audience can enjoy it. The quiz takes the answers to the questions provided and gives back a results screen that depends on how many questions were answered correctly.
